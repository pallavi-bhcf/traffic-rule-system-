<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
 <P><STRONG>Traffic Rules Violation Detection and Monitoring System in Campus</STRONG>
  The project revolves around the development of a Smart Traffic Light system using Raspberry Pi
microprocessor technology. Aimed at alleviating traffic congestion, the system utilizes image
processing techniques to detect traffic jams and dynamically adjust traffic signals accordingly.
By integrating hardware and software components, the project aims to efficiently control signal
timing and phasing, thereby optimizing traffic flow on roads.<br>
The Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, storing crucial software and managing
data from various components, including cameras and sensors. Python scripts are custom-built
to facilitate the system's functionality. The project's objective is to enhance traditional traffic light
systems by intelligently routing vehicle and pedestrian traffic based on real-time traffic
conditions. By accurately recording vehicle counts and analyzing image data, the system can
make instantaneous adjustments to mitigate congestion and improve overall traffic
management.<br>
Key components of the system include the Raspberry Pi microprocessor, camera modules for
image capture, and custom Python scripts for data processing and control. Through the
seamless integration of hardware and software, the project aims to achieve a more efficient and
responsive traffic control system. Ultimately, the Smart Traffic Light system holds the potential to
significantly reduce traffic congestion and enhance road safety in urban environments, offering a
promising solution to modern traffic management challenges.<br>
